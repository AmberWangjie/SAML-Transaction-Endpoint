# SAML-Transaction-Endpoint
This project was done during my summer intern, it was built on dropwizard framework using Java. The main feature of this endpoint is to handle SAML request and generate its SAML response with proper security configuration. This endpoint is useful to be applied into idp system to accomplish SSO process.
